//#6
//create a function called 'sayHi'.
//'sayHi' should accept one argument called 'name'

//create an array called 'friends'
//create three objects that have information about your friends
//each object should have a 'name', 'age', and 'vocation' property with appropriate data

//#10
//create a function called 'nFactorial(num)'
//'nFactorial' should return the factorial of the 'num' argument
//note: the factorial of 5 is (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) ->  120
